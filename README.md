# httping
*An HTTP pinging system written in python based on requests*  
HTTPing works by sending either get or post requests to the target URL  
It is still **WIP** and will improve over time  

It will install the httpinglib folder to the /usr/local/lib/ directory  
It will install a httping excecutable to the /usr/local/bin directorry
